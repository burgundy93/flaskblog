> TL:DR - Telephone Numbers are annoying for everyone and won't exist in a decade.

The telephone was probably one of the greatest inventions that this planet ever saw. Having the technology to contact almost anyone by simply dialling his/her 10 digit telephone number, was absolutely life changing for people all around the world.
With the telephone, many industries around the world boomed, which helped infrastructures within countries to become more connected and similar technology helped the internet get going - but also, other industries like postal had to implement new strategies & services in order to survive as letters and telegrams were fast becoming obsolete. Post Offices no longer make their real money from the odd person sending a postcard once in 2 years - they now pretty much rely on individuals and companies shipping big boxes of cargo internationally and getting parcels delivered. That's the only way they can still be profitable.

But as with all things in the world, Telephony companies also had to keep on developing new products and be more innovative to keep it going and keep people excited, which later on developed into Mobile Phones which soon turned into Smart Phones, which can now do more than anyone imagined 20 years ago. And this led to tradition landline phones disappearing faster than ever before.

**What's next?**

Personally I believe telephone numbers will be next to disappear.
If I could, I would ditch my phone number TODAY... however, our banks ask for them, when we sign up for online services they often send a verification texts to make sure you're not a robot (yes, we live in an age where we have to prove we're not a robot) and that's about it..... All bullshit really and they should innovate more to find alternative ways of verifying people.

But realistically, how often do you give a phone number to another person to contact you? With apps like Telegram, KakaoTalk, Twitter and Facebook, those platforms are fast becoming the norm for contacting your friends and family - and you can contact them using only a simple username. We're still just waiting for Whatsapp to introduce usernames - but I'm pretty sure that will change.

**Compared to usernames, phone numbers are very, very limited as well as annoying in many aspects.**

 - Phone numbers are limited to a specific country and often service
   provider. Nobody roams - it's overpriced and stupid. And changing number is annoying, as you have to update all your other services again.
 - There's no control - anyone can call your number - those useless
   charities asking for donations, Microsoft "virus" scammers,
   telemarketers, etc. Unlisted numbers, Caller ID and do-not-call lists
   all tried to solve this problem, but these solutions still donâ€™t
   prevent unwanted calls, rendering it useless.
 - Normal people cannot quickly remember a 10 Digit phone number. I've been through about 6 phone numbers the last 10 years (due to    living in different places) and the only number I know off by heart was the first phone number I ever had. It's way easier to remember a username.

With all this being said, I'm pretty sure voice calls will also disappear soon. I don't even remember the last time I made a voice call.
95% of the time I text, 4% of the time I would Facetime or video call - a lot more social than a voice call and moments when this introvert goes quiet it's not as weird as over a voice call and 1% I'm on a voice call, probably when I need to call customer care because they are not responding to my public tweets.

Actually the worst is when I tweet our Internet Service provider, Vox Telecom when I think something is wrong and they tweet me back an hour later saying they couldn't reach me by phone.

Like what the hell, I tweeted you specifically because I didn't want to make a voice call. If you can't assist me on the platform I chose to contact you, what's the point of even being on that platform.

**It's time for people, companies and services around the world to prepare for a numberless world and it's going to happen faster than we think.**
