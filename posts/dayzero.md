CAPE TOWN DAY ZERO

So I made a little countdown timer for Cape Town's huge water crisis. It's quite a big deal.
Apparently that is when all the taps will run dry. Should that happen, Cape Town will be the first ever metro city in the 21 Century that will not have running water. Crazy stuff.

And the articles makes me feel guilty when I take long showers here in Durban - we don't even have water restrictions.

If you're from Cape Town - save water and all the best. Come stay with me if you need to.
